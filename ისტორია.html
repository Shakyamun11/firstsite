         <h1> ROCK N ROLL</h1>
         <p> The origins of <br>rock and roll are complex. Rock and roll emerge<br>d as a defined musical style in the United States in the ea<br>rly to mid-1950s. It derived most directly from the rh<br>ythm and blues and country music of the<br> 1940s. It was also influenced by gospel, Ti<br>n Pan Alley, and traditional folk m<br>usic.[1] Rock and roll in turn provid<br>ed the main basis for the music that, since<br> the mid-1960s, has been generally known simply as rock music.

            The phrase "rocking and rolling" originally <br>described the movement of a ship <br>on the ocean, but it was used by the <br>early 20th century, both to describe <br>a spiritual fervor and as a sexual an<br>alogy. Various gospel, blues and swing <br>recordings used the phrase before it became<br> used more frequently – but still intermittently – in the late 1930s <br>and 1940s, principally on recordings and in reviews <br>of what became known as "rhythm and blues" <br>music aimed at black audiences. In 1939 during the April 5th broadcast on “Th<br>e Fred Allen- Town Hall Tonight- Show”<br> the song “Rock and Roll” appeared as a barber shop quartet lead-<br>in. In May 1942, long before the concept of rock and roll had bee<br>n defined, a Billboard record review described Sister<br> Rosetta Tharpe's vocals on the<br> upbeat blues song "Rock Me", by Lucky Millinder, <br> as "rock-and-roll spiritual singing".
